## This is a custom trim function I made in Excel which trims any part of a string from either sides.
Parameters of the function:
- default - the default whitespace removal trim
- unequal - to trim string from both sides of a main string where the string from both sides are not equal
- left - to trim only from the left side of the string
- right - to trim only from the right side of the string
- equal left - when you have equal string on both sides but only want to trim the left part
- equal right - when you have equal string on both sides but only want to trim the right part
- equal - to trim equal string from both side of the main string
